# Tasks

<!--
STRUCTURE RULES (see CONSTITUTION.md):
- Tasks stay in their Phase section permanently — never move them
- Use inline labels: #in-progress, #blocked, #priority:high
- Mark completed: [x], skipped: [-] (with reason)
- Never delete tasks, never remove Phase headers
-->

### Phase 1: [Name] `#priority:high`
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

### Phase 2: [Name] `#priority:medium`
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Blocked

## Reference

**Task Status Labels**:
- `[ ]` — pending
- `[x]` — completed
- `[-]` — skipped (with reason)
- `#in-progress` — currently being worked on (add inline, don't move task)
