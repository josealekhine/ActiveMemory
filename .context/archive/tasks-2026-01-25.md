## In Progress

## Phase 1

- [ ] Add a `--no-integrations` or `--skip-integrations` or `--skip-hooks` or
  `--no-hooks` flag to `ctx init` so standalone
  users can skip the Claude Code (and other possible future)
  integration setup.

## Phase 2

- [ ] Enforce test coverage targets in CI/Makefile #priority:medium #area:quality
    - internal/cli: 60% (currently 62.8%)
    - internal/context: 80% (currently 86.8%)
    - internal/drift: 80% (currently 88.0%)
    - internal/claude: 80% (currently 87.5%)
    - internal/templates: 80% (currently 88.9%)
